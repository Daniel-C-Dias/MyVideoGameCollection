Application to Better Manage My Video Game Collection

Since I have so many video games for many different systems, sometimes when shopping I have no idea if I already bought a certain game or not, also it's just a little tedious to update an excel document everytime I buy a new one, with all the searching for the correct sheet and having to sort everthing alphabetically. So to get some more experience developing using C#, I'm trying to create an app that will help manage my collection, allowing me to add/delete titles, show existing ones, ect.
